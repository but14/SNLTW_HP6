        <h2>Sports Car</h2>
        <p>A sports car is a lightweight, fun-to-drive vehicle designed for agility and sharp handling rather than extreme speed. These cars typically have between 250 to 500 horsepower and are great for winding roads, weekend driving, or track use at an entry level. They often prioritize driver engagement over luxury or straight-line performance. Examples include the Mazda MX-5, Toyota GR Supra, and Porsche 718 Cayman.

        <h2>Super car</h2>
        <p>A supercar takes performance to the next level. These vehicles usually produce 500 to 800 horsepower and are built with exotic designs, advanced materials, and mid-engine layouts. Supercars are faster, more expensive, and less practical than sports cars. They're meant to impress both in looks and on the road. Popular examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Hurac√°n, and McLaren Artura.
